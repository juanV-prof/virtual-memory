This project simulates a virtual memory system using segmentation and paging. It was written in Python using VSCode. No compilation is needed. 
To run, place `main.py`, `memory.py`, `manager.py`, `init.txt`, and `input.txt` in the same folder. 
The program reads from the init and input files and writes the results to `output.txt`. An example run is:

```bash
python main.py init.txt input.txt output.txt
