I used Python in VSCode for this project.

To use:

-No compilation needed

Simply run the main.py file in the terminal with the init.txt and input.txt alongside 
the output.txt file. It will read from the init and input file and put 
the results in the output file. Just have main.py, memory.py, manager.py, 
init.txt, and input.txt in the same folder.

An example run is "python main.py init.txt input.txt output.txt"
